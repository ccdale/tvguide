# Schedules Direct API Python Class

This implements a Python Object for accessing the [Schedules Direct
API](https://schedulesdirect.org/).  It is based on the work of [Steven T.
Smith on github](https://github.com/essandess/sd-py) re-written into my
coding style, with added token caching/renewing.  Thank you Steven.

While working through this I couldn't get the
[20191022](https://json.schedulesdirect.org/20191022) API version to work,
therefore this uses the
[20141201](https://json.schedulesdirect.org/20141201) version.
